## Key Insights

### 1. Universal Foundation
All 9 roadmaps build upon the HTML/CSS/JavaScript foundation. These three technologies are essential entry points into web development.

### 2. Framework Choice
After mastering JavaScript, developers must choose between:
- **React** (most popular, ecosystem-focused)
- **Vue** (progressive, gentle learning curve)
- **Angular** (enterprise-grade, opinionated)

### 3. TypeScript Adoption
TypeScript has become increasingly important across all frameworks:
- **Angular:** Required (TypeScript-first)
- **Vue:** Optional but recommended
- **React:** Optional but recommended

### 4. Complementary Skills
- **Frontend + Design System** = Full design system engineering
- **Frontend + UX Design** = User-centric development
- **All frameworks + Design System** = Comprehensive platform building

### 5. Progressive Complexity
Each roadmap is designed with progressive difficulty:
- Single-topic focus (HTML, CSS)
- Expanding to multi-domain (JavaScript, TypeScript)
- Framework-specific (React, Vue, Angular)
- Specialized disciplines (UX Design, Design Systems)
