# Frontend & UI Development

## Quick Start

Learn modern web development starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, progressing to advanced frameworks and UX design.

### Essential Technologies
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Styling, Flexbox, Grid, Animations
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Programming and interactivity
- **React/Vue/Angular** - Component-based frameworks
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling

### Core Frameworks
```javascript
// React Example
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
